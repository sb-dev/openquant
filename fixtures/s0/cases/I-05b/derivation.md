# I-05b: High below low is rejected as invalid input

Origin: derived by `fixtures/s0/oracle/oracle.py` from OQ-02 sections 2.1 to 2.6 and the declared policy semantics; the oracle uses exact rational arithmetic and never reads the Rust engine. Status: not individually hand-checked. Covers: Invalid inputs.

## Design

A bar's high (48.5) is below its low (49): an impossible bar. Preparation rejects it with INVALID_INPUT.

## Inputs

- Strategy: `strategy.json` (strategy hash `sha256:9607443b38bc920cb88cf7f86e15e0bd8c30162f33c9b80ec7b5facc49b2611d`).
- Input hash binding in `input.json`: `sha256:9607443b38bc920cb88cf7f86e15e0bd8c30162f33c9b80ec7b5facc49b2611d`.
- Policy: price scale 2, quantity scale 0, money scale 2, diagnostic scale 4, lot size 1; fixed fee 1.00 per fill, 10 bps, gap-exit slippage 0 bps; dividend withholding 0 bps.
- Windows: warm-up from 2026-01-05, scored from 2026-01-08, run ends after 2026-01-14; 8 calendar sessions, 8 bars; initial capital 5000.00.

## Expected result

Rejected before evaluation: status FAILED, code INVALID_INPUT. No journal is produced.
